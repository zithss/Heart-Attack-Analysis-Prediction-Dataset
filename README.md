# Heart Attack Analysis & Visualization (Group Project) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

Short, clean README for a group project using R Markdown to explore early symptoms and predictors of heart attack risk.

## Project overview

This group project analyzes the **Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction** dataset (Rashik Rahman, Kaggle) to discover early indicators of heart attack risk using data mining and visualization techniques. The work focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visual insights, and identifying significant predictors.

## Data

* Source: Kaggle ‚Äî *Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction* (Rashik Rahman)
* Key variables include: `Age, Sex, ChestPainType, RestBloodPressure, Cholesterol, FastingBloodSugar, RestECG, MaxHeartExercise, ExerciseAngina, SegmentDepression, SegmentSlope, MajorVesselsColored, ThalassemiaType, HeartAttack` (target).

---

## What we did

* Performed thorough **EDA** to understand distributions, correlations, and class imbalance.
* Visualized important relationships (e.g., chest pain types vs. heart attack, thalassemia categories, major vessels colored).
* Identified and reported features associated with elevated heart attack risk.
* Produced an R Markdown report (`.Rmd`) with code, plots, interpretation, and final recommendations.

## Key findings

* Individuals with **Non-Anginal pain (ChestPainType = 2)** showed higher susceptibility to heart attacks.
* A value of **0** in `MajorVesselsColored` (CAA) was associated with increased vulnerability in this dataset.
* **Thalassemia type 2 (Reversible Defect)** significantly correlated with a higher likelihood of heart attack.
